\section{De-Spin Equations}
Three primary sources have been compiled to verify the feasibility of yo-yo despin: a Princeton course \cite{princeton-course} (masses released tangentially), an unclassified NASA paper \cite{eom-despin-dtic} (masses released radially), and an Attitude Dynamics textbooks \cite{curtis-orbital-mech} (masses released either tangentially or radially). When using the assumptions that: (1) the cord unwinds at a constant rate equal to the vehicleâ€™s initial angular velocity and (2) final angular velocity is 0, each source gives the same equation for the corresponding type of release.

If \(I\) is the moment of inertia of the satellite excluding the yo-yo masses,

\[ \Psi = 1 + \frac{I}{mr^2} \]

If the final angular velocity is zero:

\[ l =  \]
